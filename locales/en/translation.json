Both the CA Launcher and the mod manager use used_mods.txt which is in the same folder where wh3.exe is.",
  "faqSecondH": "How does multiplayer compatibility work?",
  "faqSecondC": "Both games need to have the same mods enabled, with the same load order. If any of the mods are outdated the game will also complain. The mods also need to be in the same location, so you can't have mods in the data folder with the other player having them in the content folder. A quick check would be comparing your used_mods.txt files, they should be the same.",
  "faqThirdH": "Content mods vs data mods?",
  "faqThirdC1": "These refer to the 2 folders from which the mods are usually loaded.",
  "faqThirdC2": "Content folder is where Steam saves the mods you're subscribed to, for WH3 it could be C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\workshop\\content\\1142710, where 1142710 is the Steam Id for WH3. Data folder is in the game folder (e.g. C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Total War WARHAMMER III\\data) and also contains the vanilla .pack files like data.pack.",
  "faqThirdC3": "Data folder is mostly used by modders who put their .pack files there when working on their mods. There is a performance benefit in loading time if you put all your mods in the data folder instead of content subfolders, my guess is due to having fewer folder lookup locations for assets, it's something CA should hopefully fix. That is why there are options for this in Other Options.",
  "faqThirdC4": "Using the Copy To Data button in Other Options will copy mods to data and they'll have a red color in the manager. But if a mod gets updated the updated version will be in the content folder so you'll have to use the button again. This can be used as a way to keep all your mods un-updated when a game update hits.",
  "faqThirdC5": "Using Create symbolic links in data is a way to have mods in data, while also having them in sync with the content mods, so they're always up-to-date but you get some performance benefits. Symbolic links are a Windows feature, basically advanced shortcuts.",
  "faqFourthH": "Should I change my load order?",
  "faqFourthC1": "You should always leave the load order at default and not change it manually unless explicitly told to do so by a modder. Modders have multiple methods that they use to ensure their mods work as they should using the default load order.",
  "faqFourthC2": "If you have purely visual mods that change the same unit you could try changing the load order, but otherwise changing load order is HIGHLY unlikely to solve any other mod issues or bugs ingame, and can cause new ones to pop up.",
  "faqFifthH": "How do mods and load order work?",
  "faqFifthC1": "Mods with a lower order number have a higher priority. By default, mods are ordered alphanumerically by their name. Modders name their mods and use prefixes like ! to achieve the load order they want their mod to have.",
  "faqFifthC2": "(See What is a pack file? above) Database files in a pack have priority based on the name the modder gave that file. This is an INTERNAL name for a specific file inside the mod that has nothing to do with the mod name. So if you have 2 mods that change the unit stats of Empire swordsmen the mod with the higher DATABASE FILE priority (dictated by comparing the names of the 2 files) will be the one that applies its unit stats. This uses the INTERNAL name of the database file, NOT THE NAME OF THE MOD/PACK. Changing the load order of those 2 mods does NOTHING in this case! Load order is the same as changing the EXTERNAL name of the mod file, but here we'd have to change the INTERNAL file of the mod specific database file, something lord order cannot do anything about.",
  "faqFifthC3": "On the other hand, for individual files that aren't database files mod priority matters. Here they can change for example the same texture or the same UI file and the mod with the higher priority (lower order) will be the one that applies its changes.",
  "faqFifthC4": "A lot of such individual files are related to how the unit visuals are constructed ingame, so if you have 2 visual mods that both change the visuals of the Empire swordsmen changing load order for them could dictate what visuals you end up with ingame.",
  "faqFifthC5": "There is more nuance here, for example, a modder can use a Database way to completely change the visuals of the Empire swordsmen by telling the game to use a new .variantmeshdefinition file for the Empire swordsmen, and any other mod that replaces an existing .variantmeshdefinition of Empire swordsmen would do nothing in that case, no matter the load order.",
  "faqFifthC6": "A translation mod should NEVER require you to change load order manually, if a modder tells you to do this tell him to give his .loc file in the translation mod a higher priority than the original .loc (he can do this by adding ! in front of the .loc name)",
  "faqSixthH": "What is a pack file?",
  "faqSixthC": "Modders use \"mod\" and \"pack\" interchangeably. Each mod comes in a single .pack file, you can think of it as a zip file (even though it's not compressed) that contains files inside it. Inside a pack there is a Database portion with files filled with tabular data the game can use, and a file portion with various files the game knows how to use like textures and custom CA file formats like animations, models, and so on.",
  "faqSeventhH": "Why are my mods in red in the manager?",
  "faqSeventhC": "If a mod name is in red it means the mod is located in the data folder. If you run the Kaedrin Mod Manager it copies mods to data automatically, so that is a possible reason. You can use the Clear Data button in Other Options to remove them from data.",
  "faqEightH": "How do I reset my load order?",
  "faqEightC": "You can reset load order to default for all mods by right clicking on the Order column header. Or for individual mods right click on their order number.",
  "faqNinthH": "How do I change load order?",
  "faqNinthC1": "You can change load order in the Enabled Mods Tab. You can switch to that tab using the button in the top left or using Ctrl+2. It's not great UI, but required due to load order being relative to other enabled mods, also why most mod managers use 2 lists of mods.",
  "faqNinthC2": "Also remember load order is something that you shouldn't tinker with manually in WH3, except in some very rare circumstances. If you're unsure you're much better off leaving it at default, changing load order isn't something that will fix mod issues or bugs in WH3.",
  "faqTenthH": "Why don't you flag mods as outdated like the CA Launcher?",
  "faqTenthC": "The CA Launcher auto-flags all mods as outdated after every major patch. This way is completely meaningless, as a modder most of my mods have never actually been affected at all by any of the patches. This mod manager has a smarter checker that looks inside mods to see if they have files/tables that could be outdated. This can't catch all issues but can catch big breaking changes by patches.",
  "faqEleventhsH": "The mod manager uses a lot of memory?",
  "faqEleventhsC": "The mod manager runs analysis of enabled mods to check if they have files/tables that could be outdated or to power other features like mod customization, and that can consume a lot of memory depending on what mods you have enabled. All this memory is discarded when the game is launched to avoid performance issues.",
